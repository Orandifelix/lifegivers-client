      <h2>Who Can Donate Platelets</h2>
      <p>
        By becoming a platelet donor, you can join a community of active donors across England who save lives every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be able to donate platelets if you have the right blood type, a high enough platelet count, and have given blood before.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'd like to hear from you if you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have A negative, A positive, or AB negative blood</li>
        <li>Have given blood or platelets before</li>
        <li>Are aged between 17 and 70 (if you are over 70 and have donated blood or platelets within the last two years, you are still eligible)</li>
        <li>Have enough blood to donate safely</li>
        <li>Are able to regularly spare up to 2 hours to donate at least 4 times a year</li>
        <li>Can travel to a donor center</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Check how much blood you have:</p>
      <p>
        You need to have enough blood to donate platelets safely.
      </p>
